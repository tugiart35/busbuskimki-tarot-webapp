TarotKart Illustration Prompts

Style:
Generate a high-resolution tarot card illustration in a traditional tarot style with subtle influences from Art Nouveau and esoteric mysticism. The artwork should be richly detailed and visually symbolic, respecting the archetypal meaning of each specific card.

Composition:
Depict the central archetype or symbolic figure of the selected tarot card (e.g., The Fool, The High Priestess, The Tower, etc.) in a dynamic and meaningful posture. Include key symbolic elements traditionally associated with that card (e.g., animals, objects, gestures, landscapes) in accordance with established tarot iconography.

Color Palette:
Use a mystical and emotionally resonant palette, emphasizing tones such as:

	•	Deep purples (intuition, mystery)
	•	Royal burgundy (power, depth)
	•	Bright cosmic blues (clarity, spirit)
	•	Additional earth tones, gold, or shadowy hues can be used depending on the mood of the card.

Background Elements:
Include atmospheric, symbolic backdrops (e.g., cliffs, mountains, temples, celestial bodies) that reflect the card’s metaphysical or psychological theme. Incorporate natural elements that reinforce the spiritual journey or inner transformation.

Borders & Frame:
Use ornate, symmetrical, Art Nouveau-style borders. Optional fine-line gold or silver detailing is acceptable. The card should resemble a sacred, collectible art piece.

No Text Policy:
⚠️ Strictly no text, numbers, titles, or labels should appear on the illustration. This includes card names, Roman numerals, keywords, or any signature. The visual must stand alone as a pure symbolic image.

Mood & Energy:
Capture the emotional frequency and archetypal essence of the card — whether it is joyful and open (like The Sun), shadowy and intense (like Death or The Tower), or inward and contemplative (like The Hermit). The viewer should intuitively feel the card’s meaning.
