        "short_description": "The Fool card represents the starting point of life. This card speaks of the courage to step into the unknown, trusting the intuition that comes from your heart. The Fool symbolizes rebirth by shedding the burdens of the past, and embracing curiosity instead of fear as a guide. The upright position brings a new beginning, freedom, and inner renewal. The reversed position carries a warning of carelessness, haste, and a lack of direction. In love, career, and spiritual growth, this card reminds you that taking risks must be balanced with wisdom. The Fool's energy is a powerful sign that the Universe is cooperating with you.",
        "meanings": {
          "upright": {
            "general": "The Fool is the first breath of life's cycle. This card teaches you trust and surrender, inviting you to embark on a new path by opening your heart. While stepping into the unknown can sometimes be frightening, true growth begins there. The Fool's calling is a gentle reminder to take risks, but not to forget the voice of your soul. Your intuition strengthens during this period, and you may make spontaneous decisions. However, the core message is clear: The Universe supports you, you just need to take the step. The energy of The Fool is about believing in the magic of life again.",
            "love": "In the realm of love, The Fool card heralds refreshed emotions and new beginnings. If you are single, you may meet someone who accepts you for your authenticity. For those in a relationship, it signifies revitalization and the return of playfulness and joy. The Fool wants you to experience love as an adventure, but also reminds you of the importance of groundedness. Remember to listen to your partner while opening your heart.",
            "career": "In your career, The Fool signifies a new job, a different direction, or a creative leap. Follow your inner curiosity but avoid acting without a plan. This card is a call to break conventional molds. Paving your own way will reward your courage. The Fool's energy is one of entrepreneurship, originality, and the awakening of inner potential.",
            "money": "In financial matters, The Fool carries the theme of unexpected opportunities and liberation. You need to be cautious with your spending, as the line between freedom and extravagance is thin. This card asks you to use money energy fearlessly but consciously. The secret to abundance is internalizing the feeling of trust.",
            "spiritual": "Spiritually, The Fool describes the purest state of surrender. It is about trusting the guidance of the Universe and translating intuition into action. The Fool awakens your inner child, urging you to proceed with purity. This card is the symbol of spiritual courage: step forward, experience, and grow."
          },
          "reversed": {
            "general": "The Reversed Fool points to carelessness, impatience, or a loss of inner direction. Before starting a new path, pause and review your intention. This card reminds you that freedom must be balanced with responsibility. Notice when you are listening to your fears instead of your heart when in doubt. When The Fool is reversed, it is time to take conscious steps, not hasty ones.",
            "love": "In love, the reversed Fool indicates a tendency to act without thinking, emotional superficiality, or an overly idealistic approach to someone. Open your heart but maintain your boundaries. This card suggests that impulsive decisions can harm your relationship. Hasty steps may lead to regret.",
            "career": "The reversed Fool carries a warning of lack of direction and indiscipline in your career. If you want to change jobs or start new projects, make a plan first. True freedom is born not of chaos, but of awareness. Prepare patiently during this time, because without a solid foundation, success will not be lasting.",
            "money": "In the financial realm, carelessness, risky investments, or uncontrolled spending may be seen. The reversed Fool asks you to act consciously in money matters. Choose long-term security over instant gratification. Listen to your advisor or your intuition in your financial decisions.",
            "spiritual": "The reversed Fool signals impatience or false awareness in spiritual development. Spiritual ascent happens through depth, not speed. Meditation, patience, and a simple life will center you during this period. Wisdom takes root in silence."

          "mythology": "In mythology, The Fool combines the archetypes of both the wise and the pure. It is associated with the youth of Hermes in Greek mythology and the playfulness of Krishna in the Hindu tradition. These figures teach that experience, not just knowledge, is the true teacher. The Fool teaches you to trust the compass of your heart beyond your mind. In Anatolian culture, the 'deli' (fool) is also a symbol of a saint who lives divine love.",
          "history": "The Fool card is one of the oldest symbols in tarot. In the 15th-century Marseille deck, 'Le Mat' is drawn as a traveling figure. In the 20th-century Rider–Waite version, a young man with a sack on his shoulder and a dog beside him stands at the edge of a cliff. This image symbolizes the spiritual courage of the modern age: take your heart as your guide, and set out.",
